# COSC499Ex1

This repo is for an individual assignment completed for UBCO COSC499

I have chosen to complete two simple string excersises. The first checks to see if an inputted string is balanced. In this context balanced means that after converting each character to a value based off of its place in the alphabet and each half's values have been summed that they are equal to each other.

For example: catch --> ca|ch  --> 3 + 1 != 3 + 7 --> 4 != 10 ... This is not balanced
             zips --> zi|ps --> 26 + 9| 16 + 19 --> 35|35 ... This is balanced
             
For the second excersise I checked whether an inputted word was a palindrome or not. 

For example: Ogopogo is a palindrome
              catch is not a palindrome
